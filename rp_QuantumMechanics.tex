\section{Schroedinger equation and unitary evolution}

We start with the Schroedinger equation
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condSchroedingerEq}
	\tag{DR-SCEQ}
	\eqtext{The evolution follows the equation $\imath \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \psi(t) = H \psi(t)$ where $H$ is a self-adjoint operator}
\end{equation}

We now want to write the evolution as an operator that act on a wave function. The infinitesimal time step is going to be
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\psi(t+dt) &= \psi(t) + d\psi(t) + \psi(t) + \frac{d}{dt} \psi(t) dt \\
		&= \psi(t)+ \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} \psi(t)\\
		&= \left(1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right)\psi(t) \\
		&= U_{dt}\psi(t)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that, since $H$ is a self-adjoint operator, $U_{dt}$ is a unitary operator. In fact
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		U_{dt}^\dagger U_{dt} &= \left(1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right)^\dagger \left(1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right) \\
		&= \left(1 + \frac{H^\dagger dt}{(- \imath) \hbar}\right) \left(1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right)\\
		&= \left(1 - \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right) \left(1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right) \\
		&= 1 + \left(\frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar}\right)^2 \\
		&= 1 + O(dt^2)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This works the other way around. If we have an infinitesimal operator that is unitary, we can express it in that form. That is
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		U_{dt}\psi(t) &= \psi(t) + \frac{d\psi(t)}{dt} dt \\
		&= (1 + A dt)\psi(t) \\
		U_{dt}^\dagger U_{dt} &= \left(1 + A dt\right)^\dagger \left(1 + A dt\right) \\
		&= \left(1 + A^\dagger dt\right) \left(1 + A dt\right)\\
		&= 1 + \left(A + A^\dagger\right)dt + A^\dagger A dt^2 \\
		&= 1 + \left(A + A^\dagger\right)dt + O(dt^2) \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If we want the operator to be unitary, then we must have that $A = - A^\dagger $, which means $A$ is (anti-self-adjoint) (?). Which means we can write it as $A = \frac{H}{\imath \hbar}$ where $H$ is a self-adjoint operator. The evolution follows the Schroedinger equation.

This means that 
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condUnitaryEvolution}
	\tag{DR-UNIT}
	\eqtext{The evolution is unitary: preserves the norm: $U^{\dagger}_{\Delta t} U_{\Delta t} = 1$} 
\end{equation}
is equivalent to \ref{rp-qm-uev-condSchroedingerEq}.

Note that if the evolution is unitary, then the inner product is conserved. In fact
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\< U \phi | U \psi\> &= \< \phi | U^\dagger U | \psi \> \\
		&=\<  \phi | \psi \>.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The argument works in reverse as well, therefore
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condInnerProductPreserved}
	\tag{DR-INN}
	\eqtext{The evolution preserves the inner product : $\< U_{\Delta t} \phi | U_{\Delta t} \psi\> =\<  \phi | \psi \>$} 
\end{equation}
is equivalent to \ref{rp-qm-uev-condUnitaryEvolution}.


In particular, unitary evolution will preserve the norm of vectors, since $|psi|^2 = \<\psi | \psi \>$. The reverse is true as well: a transformation that preserves the norm of all state vectors is a unitary operation. This is because the inner product can be expressed, through the polarization identity, in terms of the norm.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\< \phi | \psi \> = \frac{1}{4}\left( |\phi + \psi|^2 - |\phi - \psi|^2 - \imath |\phi + \imath \psi|^2 +\imath |\phi - \imath \psi|^2 \right)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If the norm is conserved, then, the inner product is conserved and the evolultion is unitary. Therefore condition
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condNormalized}
	\tag{DR-NORM}
	\eqtext{The evolution preserves the norm: $\< \psi(t) | \psi(t) \> = \< \psi(t+dt) | \psi(t+dt) \>$} 
\end{equation}
is equivalent to condition \ref{rp-qm-uev-condInnerProductPreserved}.

We now look at the square of the inner product between two states infinitesimally close in time. We have
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		|\<\psi(t) | \psi(t + dt)\>|^2 &= \< \psi(t) | U_{d t} \psi(t)\> \< U_{d t} \psi(t) | \psi(t)\> \\
		&=\<  \psi(t) | 1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\> \<\psi(t) | \left(1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} \right)^{\dagger}| \psi(t)\> \\
		&=\<  \psi(t) | 1 + \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\> \<\psi(t) | 1 - \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\> \\
		&=\< \psi(t) | \psi(t)\> \< \psi(t) | \psi(t)\> + \<  \psi(t) | \psi(t)\> \<\psi(t) | - \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\> \\
		&+ \< \psi(t) | \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\> \<\psi(t) | \psi(t)\> + O(dt^2)\\
		&=1 - \<\psi(t) | \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\> + \<\psi(t) | \frac{H dt}{\imath \hbar} | \psi(t)\>+ O(dt^2). \\
		&=1 + O(dt^2).
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Which means that the projection of the state after an infinitesimal time step over the initial state is one. Note that the converse is true as well. If the square of the inner product between two states infinitesimally close in time is one, then the evolution is unitary. In fact, if $U_{\Delta t}$ is continuous, we can write the infintesimal time step as $U_{d t} = 1 + \frac{O dt}{\imath \hbar}$ from some operator $O$. If we follow the previous argument in reverse, we will find that $O = O^\dagger$. That is, $O$ is self-adjoint. Therefore $U_{dt}$ is unitary by condition \ref{rp-qm-uev-condSchroedingerEq}. Therefore condition
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condUnitaryBorn}
	\tag{DR-UBOR}
	\eqtext{The square of the inner product between to states infinitesimally close in time is one: $|\< \psi(t) | \psi(t + dt) \> |^2 = 1$} 
\end{equation}
is yet another equivalent condition to unitary evolution.

The above condition makes sense if we understand what happens geometrically. A unitary evolution is effectively a rotation in the Hilbert space, and the infinitesimal change under a rotation is perpendicular to the radius. In our case, the state vector $|\psi(t)\>$ is the radius and $|d\psi(t)\>$ is the change. Therefore condition
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condOrthogonalChange}
	\tag{DR-ORTH}
	\eqtext{The change in time is orthogonal to the state being changed: $|\< \psi(t) | d\psi(dt) \> |^2 = 0$} 
\end{equation}
is yet another equivalent condition.

Another way to characterize unitary evolution is through what happens to an orthonormal basis $|e_i\>$. Given that a unitary evolution preserves the inner product, $\< U_{d t} e_i | U_{d t} e_j \> = \< e_i | e_j \> = \delta_{ij}$. Therefore the unitary evolution maps an orthonormal basis to another orthonormal basis. The converse is also true, if $U_{\Delta t}$ maps an orthonormal basis to another orthonormal basis, then the inner product is preserves. To see this, we can simply expand any vector as a superposition of the basis vector. That is
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\<\psi(t) | \phi(t)\> &= \< c_i e_i | d_j e_j\> \\
		&= c_i^* d_j \< e_i | e_j\> \\
		&= c_i^* d_j \< U_{d t} e_i | U_{d t} e_j\> \\
		&= \< U_{d t} c_i e_i | U_{d t} d_i e_j\> \\
		&= \< U_{d t} \psi(t) | U_{d t} \phi(t)\> \\
		&= \< \psi(t + d t) | \phi(t + d t)\> \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Therefore condition
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condOrthonormalBasis}
	\tag{DR-OBAS}
	\eqtext{The change in time maps orthonormal basis to orthonormal basis: $\< U_{d t} e_i | U_{d t} e_j \> = \< e_i | e_j \> = \delta_{ij}$} 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Physical conditions}

In classical mechanics we saw that Hamiltonian evolution was equivalent to determinism and reversibility. The same applies to quantum mechanics. If an evolution is deterministic and reversible, then knowing the initial state means knowing the final state and vice-versa. Given that quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, this translates as being able to predict the final state or reconstruct the initial state in terms of probability. That is, if I know the initial state with 100\% probability, I will know the final state with 100\% probability and vice-versa. Mathematically, this means that if we start with a pure state $\rho(t) = |\psi(t) \> \< \psi(t)|$, then the final state will have to be $\rho(t+\Delta t) = |\psi(t+\Delta t) \> \< \psi(t+\Delta t)|$. Given that both $\rho(t)$ and $\rho(t + \Delta t)$ are trace one operators, the norm of both $\psi(t)$ and $\psi(t+\Delta t)$ must be unitary. That is, a deterministic and reversible evolution must preserve the norm. Which means that 
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condDetRev}
	\tag{DR-EV}
	\eqtext{The evolution is deterministic and reversible} 
\end{equation}

The same argument can be developed on probability distributions. Suppose that we have a mixed state, meaning that it can be understood as a classical mixture of a set of orthogonal states. If we have a deterministic and reversibile evolution evolution, we will be able to map the same distribution to another set of final state such that the probability remains unchanged. That is, if we are able to write $\rho(t) = p_i |e_i(t) \> \<e_i(t)|$, we must have $\rho(t+ \Delta t) = p_i |U_{\Delta t}e_i(t) \> \<U_{\Delta t} e_i(t)|$. For that two work, the final set of states $U_{\Delta t}e_i(t)$ must be orthogonal to each, therefore if the process transports probability distributions from initial to final observers, then it must map orthonormal basis to orthonormal basis. This means the evolution is unitary and 
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condProbTrans}
	\tag{DR-EV}
	\eqtext{The evolution preserves probability distributions} 
\end{equation}
is another equivalent conditions.

The idea here is that, in the end, determinism and reversibility is effectively a permutation of objects, while keeping the closeness (i.e. the differentiable topology) and distance (i.e. the inner product) the same.


When looking at classical mechanics, we saw that determinism and reversibility, at a conceptual level, is equivalent to conservation of information entropy. This connection is still valid in quantum mechanics. Let $\rho(t)$ be the evolution of a density operator. Let $\rho(t) = p_i |e_i(t) \> \<e_i(t)|$ the diagonalized expression for the density operator, where the basis can be, in general, different at each moment in time. Given the linearity of time evolution, the evolution will be $U_{dt} \left( p_i |e_i(t) \> \<e_i(t)| \right)= p_i |U_{\Delta t}e_i(t) \> \<U_{\Delta t} e_i(t)|$. That is, the coefficients of the probability distribution over the basis remain the same. Only the basis changes. Since the entropy only depends on the coefficients $p_i$, the entropy remains unchanged.

The converse is true: if an evolution preserves entropy, then it is unitary. First of all, note that pure states are the only states with zero entropy. Therefore pure states must be mapped to pure states. Now, consider two orthogonal states. An equal mixture of the two will give us a maximally mixed state over two pure states. This means that, given linearity, a maximally mixed state over two pure states can only be mapped to another maximally mixed state of two pure states. Therefore orthogonal states must be mapped to orthogonal states. This means that an evolution that preserves entropy must map an orthonormal basis to another orthonormal basis, and therefore it is a unitary evolution. That is, condition
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condInfoEntropy}
	\tag{DR-INFO}
	\eqtext{The evolution preserves information entropy} 
\end{equation}
is equivalent to \ref{rp-qm-uev-condSchroedingerEq}.

Note that in quantum mechanics both information entropy and thermodynamic entropy coincide, in the sense that we do not have two different definition in quantum statistical mechanics as we have in classical statistical mechanics (i.e. logarithm of count of states and Shannon entropy). What we can show, however, is that unitary evolution can be understood as an infinite sequence of projections that perturb the system minimally.

Suppose that you prepare a spin 1/2 system in the horizontal direction and then measure the vertical direction. You have equal chance of measuring spin up or spin down. Now suppose you put a polarizer (?) at a 45 degree angle in between. There will be two projection, first on the 45 degree angle and then along the vertical direction. The chance of ending in the up state is greater than ending the in down state. You can imagine inserting other to (polarizers (?)) in between again, making 4 proections at a 22.5 degree angle between each pair. The chance of ending up in the up state is even greater. We can imagine, then, that if we put infinitely many steps at infinitesimal angles, the chance of being in the up state at the end will be 100\%.

We saw, in fact, that for a unitary evolution $\<\psi(t+dt) | \psi(t)\> =1$, that is the projection of the state at a future time step on the previous time step is one. This can be understood as making a projective measurement on an observable that is slightly different to one for which $\psi(t)$ is an eigenstate. That is, we can understand unitary evolution as an infinitesimal sequence of projections at each time step.

Another way of understanding this is that determinism and reversibility can be used for both measuring and preparing states. That is, if we prepare a system in a given state, we can use unitary evolution to prepare a system in the future state. Conversely, if we can measure a system in a given state, we can use unitary evolution to infer the state of the system at a prior time. Therefore, we can understand determinism and reversibility as a series of preparations or measurements. Since measurements in quantum mechanics are projections, it makes sense that we can understand unitary evolution as a sequence of projections. Therefore 
\begin{equation}\label{rp-qm-uev-condProjectionSequence}
	\tag{DR-PSEQ}
	\eqtext{The evolution is an sequence of measurements at each time step} 
\end{equation}
is equivalent to \ref{rp-qm-uev-condDetRev}.

\section{Projection and measurements}

%TODO: settle notation for projectors in Hilbert space

WTS: Every state is an eigenstate of a unitary evolution, of a projection, and of an Observable.

Given a pure state $|\psi \>$ we can always create the operator $P_{\psi}=|\psi \> \<\psi|$. This operator has $|\psi\>$ as an eigenvector with eigenvalue one, and any state $|\phi\>$ that is orthogonal to $|\psi\>$ will also be an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero. In fact:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		P_{\psi} | \psi \> &= |\psi \> \<\psi|\psi\> = |\psi \> \\
		P_{\psi} | \phi \> &= |\psi \> \<\psi|\phi\> = |\psi \> 0 = 0 \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Note that $P_{\psi}^\dagger = P_{\psi}$ which means that this is a Hermitian operator and since  $P_{\psi}^\dagger P_{\psi}  = |\psi \> \<\psi|\psi\> \<\psi| = |\psi \> 1 \<\psi| = |\psi \> \<\psi|$

$X = |x_i\> x_i \< x_i|$

  - (?) how much can we recover?
* Space of directional pure states
  - I have a state space for directions in space
  - Recycle the argument that we have to be able to put a frame invariant distribution over it
  - -> two sphere is the only symplectic sphere and therefor is the only space
  - (?) why are ensembles the Bloch?

\section{Problems with infinite dimensional spaces}

In the previous sections we restricted ourselves to finite dimensional spaces. In these spaces all measurements can be understood as having finitely many outcomes, and all those outcomes can be understood as quantum states. In this section we will extend the discussion to the infinite case and see the extension is problematic. Infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, in fact, seem to hide the source of the infinity and require the existence of states that cannot be thought as being physically meaningful. The exact mathematical representation of these cases, then, is still an open problem.

There are two potential sources of infinity in physics: the infinitely large and the infinitely small. The infinitely large comes from unbounded quantities. For example, the number of particles in a gas or the distance of a particle from the origin of our reference system can be, in principle, arbitrarily large. In this case, infinity is just the range of possible values, and not a value itself. It would not make sense, then, to say that a gas has infinitely many particles or that a particle is infinitely distant unless we are talking about the limit of a process that takes an infinite amount of time. Noet that the infinitely large does not change the nature of the quantity: the number of particles is a discrete quantity and the position is a continuous quantity regardless of whether we are allowing an infinite range or not.

The infinitely small comes from the ability to refine measurements indefinitely. For example, we assume can measure the position of a particle with arbitrary precision. In practice, infinite precision is never realizable, but it essentially identifies the value at all level of precision. That is, if we knew the position with infinite precision we would know all the possible finite precision intervals in which the particle can be. The infinitely small, then, changes the nature of the quantity, going from discrete to continuous. Over a finite range, a discrete quantity will have finitely many possible values while a continuous quantity will have infinitely many.

We can characterize these differences in the following way. A measurement will tell us whether a particular value is within a set of possible values. If the quantity is continuous, all measurements will always restrict the range of possible values to an infinite set. That is, any measurement of position will have a finite uncertainty, which will include infinitely many possible positions. If the quantity is discrete, at some point, we will have a measurement that identifies each possible cases. That is, we can count exactly the number of particles, which restrict the measurement to only one possible case. Intuitively, the range is infinite in either cases if it cannot be always covered with finitely many measurements. That is, if we are given measurement with finite ranges, we are not going to be able to cover the infinite range with finitely many measurements.

Mathematically, this maps to properties of open sets of the topology. The topology, in fact, keeps track of the notion of closeness, and measurement resolution is about that closeness. The topology of a real line, then, is different from the topology of sets of points: the first one is topologically connected, while the second one is not. A space with a finite range is topologically compact, while one that has an infinite range is not. Establishing a perfect mapping between these concepts is not the goal of Reverse Physics, but rather of Physical mathematics. The point is: in classical mechanics the mathematics characterizes and keeps track of these differences.

The problem is that in quantum mechanics, the mathematical framework does not keep track of these differences. This is the problem we are going to explore in this section, a problem that is ultimately not solved. Given that the mathematical framework does not capture all the elements and only the elements that are physically meaningful, the Reverse Physics program cannot be fully completed for quantum mechanics.

\subsection{Equivalence of Hilbert spaces}

One feature of Hilbert spaces is that the cardinality of the base fully characterizes the space. In fact, let $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{H}_2$ be two Hilbert and let $\{e_i\}_{i \in I} \in \mathcal{H}_1$ and $\{g_i\}_{i \in I} \in \mathcal{H}_2$ be two orthonormal basis of the respective spaces with the same cardinality. Then we can define a map $m : \mathcal{H}_1 \to \mathcal{H}_2$ such that $m(\sum a_i e_i) = \sum a_i g_i$. The map is unitary since:
\begin{equation}
	TODO
\end{equation}
which means the two spaces are unitarily equivalent and therefore they are the same Hilbert space.

All spaces we are interested in quantum mechanics are going to be countable. If we imagine to extend to infinite the range of a discrete observable, we can see that we will have a countable set of possible outcomes and therefore a countable basis. If we take the space of wave functions, in either a finite or infinite range, we will get the space of square integrable functions, which also has a countable basis. To see that, note that the Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator has a discrete spectra and therefore has countably many eigenstates which will form a basis. All wave-functions, then, can be written as a superposition of eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and therefore the space has a countable basis.

In quantum mechanics, then, if the space has an infinite basis, it will be a countable spaces, which leads to the following observation: all infinite dimensional spaces in quantum mechanics are equivalent. If we have and infinite dimensional space, then, we are not going to be able to know whether we have a discrete quantity over an infinite range, a continuous quantity over a finite range or a continuous quantity over an infinite range. Mathematically, there will be no difference in the states, unlike in classical mechanics.

For example, the state space of a single DOF (i.e. $L^2(\mathbb{R})$) is going to be equivalent to the state space of $n$ DOFs (i.e. $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n))$). As we said before, the Hermite functions, the eigenstates of a Harmonic oscillator, provide a countable basis for a single DOF. We can imagine a Harmonic oscillator over 2 DOFs. In that case, the products of the Hermite functions across degrees of freedom provide a countable basis for the space. Through diagonalization, we can map one set of basis to the other
\begin{align}
	h_0(x) &\mapsto h_0(x)h_0(y) \\
	h_1(x) &\mapsto h_0(x)h_1(y) \\
	h_2(x) &\mapsto h_1(x)h_1(y) \\
	h_3(x) &\mapsto h_0(x)h_2(y) \\
	\dots
\end{align}
This idea can be generalized to map any set of $n$ DOFs to any set of $m$ DOFs. Potentially, it means that we can construct a process that can encode the information of a billion particles into a single particle.

%TODO: conjecture: these maps will not map finite expectations on one space to finite expectations on the other. That is, the do not preserve the topology of a Schwartz space. Equivalently, the domain of the pos/mom poly of the two spaces are not the same.

Note that the above transformation is not possible in classical mechanics. One degree of freedom, topologically, is $\mathbb{R}^2$ while $n$ DOFs are $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, which are not topologically equivalent. The issue is that the topology of the Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics is the one induced by the inner product and not the one induced by the observables, like in classical mechanics. Therefore the mathematical representation in quantum mechanics knows ``too little'' about the physical system it is supposed to describe.

\subsection{Domain of operators}

In the infinite dimensional case, any unbound operator $O$ will not be defined on the whole Hilbert space. That is, there will be some state $\psi$ for which $O |\psi\>$ is undefined. This may correspond, for example, to states where one has infinite energy, or a state that is a limit of a sequence for which the energy does not converge. That is, the state converges in the Hilbert space, but the value of the energy does not.

\subsection{Continuous spectra}

In the infinite dimensional cases, we have operators that have a continuous spectra, meaning that they do not have ``proper'' eigenstates. For example, for the position operator, the eigenvectors would correspond to the delta functions, which are not in the Hilbert space, but rather in the space of distributions. Therefore, there are no states with perfectly prepared position and the unitary transformation generated by position has no fixed points (i.e. equilibria, eigenstates).


\subsection{Schwartz spaces}

For multiple independent DOF of position and momentum, the requirement to have all polynomials of position and momentum with a finite expectation value recovers the Schwartz space, which is a dense subspace of the Hilbert space (i.e. any element of the Hilbert space can be understood as the limit of a sequence of Schwarz functions).


\subsection{Probability on a continuum}


For any observable with any spectra, the probability measure can be recovered in the following way. Take a Borel set. Construct the projector onto that Borel set. For example, take $X$ as the position operator. Take a Borel set $A$ and take the indicator function $1_A$ and calculated $\< \psi | 1_A | \psi \> = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \psi^\dagger 1_A \psi dx = \int_{A} \psi^\dagger 1 \psi dx = \int_{A} \psi^\dagger \psi dx$.

Conjecture: whether finite expectations map to finite expectation if and only if the velocity is bound.

%TODO: when do things blow up? https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/09/20/the-gravo-thermal-catastrophe/  "Struggles with the continuum"

%TODO: look t the following cases: 1 Hamiltonian system with either infinite or minus infinite energy at a particular point. 2 Hamiltonian system with finite Hamiltonin everywhere, but possibly infinite/minus infinite energy at infinity. 3 Hamiltonian where the energy is bound from below 4. Hamiltonian system wih energy bound from below and above. Conjecture, 3 is sufficient to preserve expectation values.

%TODO: Suppose we have a Hamiltonian system that preserves all expectation values: what we can say about the Hamiltonian?

\subsection{Self-adjoint vs Hermitian}

In some spaces,  \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38387/distinguishing-between-symmetric-hermitian-and-self-adjoint-operators}{self-adjoint is not equivalent to Hermitian.} Consider the half real-line $[0, +\infty]$. Consider the momentum operator $\imath \hbar \partial_x $. The exponential $e^{-\lambda x}$ where $\lambda > 0$ is an eigenstate of momentum
\begin{equation}
	\imath \hbar \partial_x e^{-\lambda x} = - \lambda \imath \hbar e^{-\lambda x}
\end{equation}
with eigenvalue is $- \lambda \imath \hbar$ which is imaginary.

In the finite dimensional case, all self-adjoint are Hermitian.

Definition of Hermitian adjoint. Given $O$, the Hermitian adjoint $O^\dagger$ is such that:
\begin{equation}
	\<\psi|O \phi\> = \< O^\dagger \psi | \phi \>
\end{equation}
where $\psi, \phi \in D(O)$ (i.e. the operator is defined on the vectors).

\section{WARNINGS}

\textbf{Every state (even if I restrict to Schwartz space) is an eigenstate of some projection, observable and unitary, because $|\psi \> \< \psi|$ is always defined.}

\textbf{Not every projector, observable or unitary can be understood as having eigenstates. For example, projection on a Borel set of position.}


Questions:
* Can we see the position operator as the limit of a discretized position operator where the discretization is smaller and smaller? If we did the same with momentum, would the commutator between them become $\imath \hbar$.

(?) Generalize this to arbitrary dimensions

(?) Random things to look at to see whether they are helpful
* Kähler manifold, interplay of symplectic structure with metric tensor
* Is anything of the old arguments salvageable?
* See if there is anything we can get from GPT or other reconstructions
