% TODO: review classical uncertainty principle

Review of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
* wave-function (postulates - rays of Hilbert space)
- states are rays in Hilbert space
- observables are Hermitian operator inner product, Born rule, projection as final state
- composite systems (tensor product)
- unitary evolution
* mixtures and entropy

Composite system
* Show that system composition of quantum systems that is itself a quantum system gives the tensor product
* Review the arguments in the paper
* see if using a Segre embedding would make our life easier

Unitary evolution is deterministic and reversible evolution
* Conservation of entropy
* Conservation of probability (i.e. unitary evolution)
* (?) Preservation of uncertainty (would require CPTP)
* Continuous sequences of measurements 

Projections are processes with equilibria (all fine states are equilibria)
* (?) Projection is not enough: need compatility with a unitary evolution
* Show that projections cannot decrease entropy
* Eigenstates of projections are equlibria => all quantum states are equilibria of projection
  - Mathematically, this is what Hilbert spaces add on top of Banach spaces
* Analogy to thermodynamics (context is like different type of ensembles)
* Unitary evolution is quasi-static evolution (like in thermodynamics)
  - Make the parallel to S-matrix calculation where we put initial state at minus infinity, and final state at plus infinity for a process that actually last "femtoseconds"

Observables
* (?) Convex maps of mixed states are Hermitian operators
* Is it useful to note that any observable is compatible to some unitary? That is, any observable is left unchanged by a unitary?

Open quantum systems
* Review open quantum system (Lindblad master equation)
* (?) recover CPTP maps 
- Linear maps : map mixed states to mixed states while preserving mixtures
- Trace preserving : map trace one operators to trace one operators
- Positive : mixed states have non-negative eigenvalues
- Completely Positive: (?) need a characterization of completely positive in terms of only the system, without the ancilla
* (?) Kraus operator, jump operatos: how are they related? If they are?
* (?) What are the possible motions on a Bloch sphere? That is, what are the possible vector fields described by the Lindblad equation

Classical limit
* Classical mechanics is the high entropy limit of quantum mechanics
- Find classical transformations that increase entropy, show that they are all "unitaries" plus stretch of phase space
- Find equivalent of phase space stretching in quantum mechanics
- See that it is a CPTP map only defined in the anti-normal ordering
- Show that it rescales the commutator by the factor for phase space stretching
- Show that this is equivalent to the limit of $\hbar \to 0$

Negative probability in quantum mechanics
* QM on phase space (Wigner functions - Hussimi - Glauber–Sudarshan)
* (real) convex combination vs affine combination vs linear combination
* => QM on phase space is using affine combinations, since convex combinations are not sufficient

Quantum states as equibria
* Show that for a unitary evolution, eigenstates are equilibria
* Show that any quantum state is an eigenstate of some unitary
* => all quantum states are equilibria of unitary

(?) Recover spin 1/2 (two state systems)
* Space of ensembles that is fully characterized by an average direction.
  - Gaussian states are fully identified by average and standard deviation
  - Suppose we have "guassian states" of directions with same standard deviation
  - -> the space is a ball
  - (?) how much can we recover?
* Space of directional pure states
  - I have a state space for directions in space
  - Recycle the argument that we have to be able to put a frame invariant distribution over it
  - -> two sphere is the only symplectic sphere and therefor is the only space
  - (?) why are ensembles the Bloch?
  
Problems with infinite dimensional spaces
* Unsuitability of Hilbert space
  - Hilbert spaces with different number of DOF are equivalent
  - Ill-defined expectations: states with infinite energy/undefined position and so on...
  - TODO: take all the arguments from the paper
* Suitability of Schwartz spaces for special case

(?) Generalize this to arbitrary dimensions

(?) Random things to look at to see whether they are helpful
* Kähler manifold, interplay of symplectic structure with metric tensor
* Is anything of the old arguments salvageable?
* See if there is anything we can get from GPT or other reconstructions
