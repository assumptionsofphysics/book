This part is dedicated to preliminary ideas and work in progress, meaning that it includes conjectures, current thinking and approaches that may or may not turn out to be good ideas. As the work matures, sections and chapters from this part will be merged into the main part.

The first chapter will give an overview of rough general ideas within reverse physics. The second chapter will do the same for physical mathematics. The subsequent chapters capture an in-depth stab at a particular problem that, if solved, it would likely turn out to be a standalone chapter in either reverse physics or physical mathematics.
