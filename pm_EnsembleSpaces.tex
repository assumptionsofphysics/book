\chapter{Ensemble spaces}

Here we summarize the work in progress for a general theory of states and processes that is applicable to any physical system. The tentative core concept is the ensemble, therefore we want to find definitional requirements for ensembles and then find suitable assumptions to recover the different theories (e.g. classical, quantum and thermodynamic).

 Conceptually, we want to argue that physical theories are, and can only be, about ensembles. At a practical level, most of the time we can only prepare and measure statistical properties as we do not have infinite control over all systems. The cases where properties can be prepared with one hundred percent reliability can still be understood as a ensembles of identical preparations, though one can argue for an ensemble of external conditions or internal dynamics. At a conceptual level, the goal of physics is to write laws that apply all the time: every time that one prepares a system according to a particular procedure, let's it evolve in particular conditions, he will obtain a particular result. That is, the idea of repeatability of experimental results implicitly assumes that the objects of scientific inquiry are not single instances, but the infinite collections of all reproducible instances.

\section{Working examples}

A general theory of ensembles will need to be able to recover classical spaces and quantum spaces under appropriate physically meaningful assumptions. There are two aspects that are common to all cases, that can be suitably generalized: statistical mixing and entropy. It is useful, then, to review the cases we need to recover. For now, we will leave field theories out of this treatment.

\subsection{Classical case - discrete}

\subsubsection{Convex structure}

The space of classical distributions over a discrete space corresponds to a simplex (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex}). In the finite case, the pure states $\mathcal{G} = \{g_i\}_{i=1}^{n} \subset \Ens$ are finitely many and each ensemble $e = \sum p_i g_i$ is uniquely identified by a decomposition of pure states. Effectively, each ensemble is a probability distribution over the pure states. Mathematically, each point of the space is a convex combination of the vertices. The simplex has a center point, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state, a uniform distribution over all pure states.

The countably infinite case is a bit different because not all infinite sequences $\{p_i\} \in [0,1]$ converge. As we cannot create a uniform distribution over infinitely many cases, there is no center point. Effectively, there is ``hole'' in the middle. More precisely, the space is not topologically closed in the sense it does not contain all the limit points.

The uncountably infinite case is not physically relevant (i.e. no second countable discrete topology, cases are not experimentally decidable).

TODO: Understand the space of the limits. There should be at least one point for each sequence $\{p_i\}$ that converges to a finite $p < 1$. Intuitively, we can keep that part of the distribution constant while we spread the rest uniformly to all cases. Each should reach a different limit point.

\subsubsection{Entropic structure}

Each ensemble $e$ has a single decomposition $e = \sum p_i g_i$ in terms of pure states. The entropy is given by $-\sum p_i \log p_i$ for both finite and countable cases. Therefore the entropy for each pure state is assumed to be zero. The entropy of the maximally mixed state is $\log n$ where $n$ is the number of pure states. The entropy increase as we go from pure states to the maximally mixed state. The level sets (i.e. the fibers) of the entropy form a series of concentric ``shells''.

Note that the entropy is not finite for all convergent $p_i$ (i.e. infinite convex combinations). For details, see \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5630.pdf}. Given that we will want the entropy to exist and be finite for all ensembles, this means that simply generalizing the convex space to all probability measures (like in \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/superconvex+space} ) does not seem physically warranted.

The fact that all pure states have the same entropy is an additionally hypothesis that cannot work in general. To see this, consider the case where the state is defined by the number of molecules for two substances. This space is the product of two independent variable $n_a$ and $n_b$. If we have a uniform distribution over $N_a$ cases of $n_a$ and $N_b$ cases of $n_b$, the total number of cases is $N_a N_b$. Therefore the entropy of the joint state is the sum of the entropy of the marginals. However, if we pair $n_a$ with the total number of molecules $n_{(a+b)}$ we have a problem. The issue that variable $n_{(a+b)}$ corresponds to a variable number of joint cases.

\subsection{Classical case - continuous}

\subsubsection{Convex structure}

In the continuous case, the space of ensembles is the space of integrable functions over a symplectic manifold (e.g.  over phase space) that integrate to one. That is, if $X$ is a symplectic manifold, then $\Ens = L^1(X, \mu)$ where $\mu=\int \omega^n$ is the Liouville measure. The pure states are the space of delta distributions $\mathcal{G} = \{\delta_x\}_{x \in X}$, but they are not in  $\Ens$: they are limit points. If we imagine a uniform distribution over a region of the symplectic manifold, we now have two limits that are not part of the ensemble space: the limit with infinite support, and the limit of zero support. In some sense, a distribution can be understood as a convex integral of the zero support limits: $\rho(x) = \int_X \rho(y) \delta_x(y) d\mu$. Even in this case, each ensemble can be understood as a probability distribution (density in this case) over all pure states. The symplectic nature of the manifold is require to assign a frame invariant density to states and a frame invariant notion of independence between DOFs.

TODO: We have already shown that that the ability to define frame-independent probability densities on pure states is linked to the existence symplectic structure. The notion of independence of DOF should be connected to a notion of product of convex spaces. As defined below, the entropic structure is defined already in a frame independent way (at least at constant time). There may be a way to make the argument tighter from a mathematical perspective.

TODO: The pure states are not part of the space: they are limits. Technically, they are not extreme points. We should have a definition of pure states that recovers all notions of pure states.

\subsubsection{Entropic structure}

The entropy is given by $- \int \rho \log \rho d\mu$ where $\mu$ is the Liouville measure and $\rho$ is the probability density over canonical coordinates. If a different measure is used, or if the coordinates are not canonical, the formula gives the wrong result.

Unlike the classical discrete case, subspaces and dimensionality of subspaces cannot be defined without the entropy. The issue is that we need a measure on the set of ``extreme points'', and the convex structure cannot provide it. The entropy, however, does as the supremum of the entropy for all distributions with support $U$ is $\log \mu(U)$.

The entropy can be used to both identify subspaces and recover the Liouville measure. Take $\rho \in X$; construct the set $\text{dis}(\rho)$ of all the ensembles that are disjoint from $\rho$; now construct the set $\text{con}(\rho)$ of all ensembles that are disjoint from all elements of $\text{dis}(\rho)$. These will be the set of ensembles that share the supports. Find the supremum of $\text{dis}(\rho)$ in terms of the entropy. If it doesn't exists, the support is infinite. If it does, the support is finite and the measure is $2^{\sup S(\text{con}(\rho))}$.

TODO: Study the shell of zero entropy states. For example, it should not be path connected: all uniform distributions with support of the same finite size (in terms of Liouville measure) will have the same entropy. The region, however, need not be contiguous. Since we cannot continuously transform a single region into two disjoint regions, there will be different distributions at zero entropy that cannot be transformed continuously.


\subsection{Quantum case - finite dimensional}

\subsubsection{Convex structure}

For a qubit, the Bloch ball is the space of ensembles $\Ens$. That is, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a two dimensional Hilbert space. The interior of the block sphere correspond to mixtures (i.e. the space of positive semi-definite Hermitian operators with trace one $M(\mathcal{H})$) while the surface corresponds to the pure states $\mathcal{G}$ (i.e. $\{ |\psi\> \<\psi| \}_{\psi \in \mathcal{H}}$). In this case, there is no single decomposition. The general finite dimensional case works similarly. Note that the space is exactly characterized by knowing which different mixtures provide the same ensemble.

The multiple decompositions make the ensemble space behave in a way that is a hybrid between the classical discrete and continuous. Pure states are properly a part of the state, as in the discrete case, and we can describe each mixture in terms of finitely many states. However, the pure state are a continuum, therefore we can also define probability densities over the space, convex integrals. For example, for a single qubit, the maximally mixed state (the center of the sphere) can be equally described as the equal mixture of two opposite states (e.g. spin up and spin down, or spin left and spin right). However, it can also be described as the equal mixture of the whole sphere.

Note that complex projective are symplectic, which is what allows to define frame invariant densities. Ideally, whatever formal argument we are able to work for classical mechanics would also apply to quantum mechanics.  Also note that the two dimensional sphere is the only symplectic sphere. By homogeneity, we should be able to argue that the space is symmetric around the maximally mixed state, and is therefore a ball. The symplectic requirement would select dimension two. Note that real and quaternionic spaces would be excluded by this argument.

\subsubsection{Entropic structure}

In quantum mechanics, the entropy is the von Neumann entropy for both finite and infinite dimension. The entropy for the maximally mixed state is $\log n$ where $n$ is the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. Note that, to calculate the von Neumann entropy, we are diagonalizing the density matrix $\rho$. This means finding a set of orthogonal pure states $g_i$ such that $\rho = \sum p_i g_i$ is a convex combination. Note that the convex hull of a set of $n$ orthogonal pure states is an $n$-dimensional simplex whose center is the maximally mixed state. Therefore, we are looking for the smallest simplex that contain $\rho$ and the maximally mixed state. In the two dimensional case, $\rho$ is an interior point. Take the line that connects $\rho$ to the center. The two points of the sphere are the extreme points for the decomposition. The distance from the points will be proportional to the probability. Because of this property, the von Neumann entropy is the smallest Shannon entropy between all possible decompositions.


\subsection{Quantum case - infinite dimensional}

The infinite dimensional can be both understood as the countably infinite dimensional version of the discrete case, or as the space of complex square integrable functions. As in the  (i.e. $L^2$) should work the same, except that there is no upper bound on the entropy, and therefore there is no maximally mixed state.

As in the classical infinite case, the maximally mixed state is not in the convex space.

TODO: It is not clear what is the correct space for the infinite dimensional case. The Hilbert space contains pure states that have infinite expectation values. Schwartz spaces do not have this problem, but the order of the basis seems relevant as the rate of convergence is defined with that in mind. A reorder of the basis, in fact, can change the rate of convergence. Take, for example, a series that converges faster than any polynomial. Now construct a series by adding a zero term in between every non-zero term. The series will also converge faster than any polynomial. Now rearrange the zero so that the terms get more and more spread out. At some point, the rate of convergence of the series will change. It is unclear what is the relationship between the topology of these limits points and the convex/entropic structure. Related question is whether $S(\mathbb{R})$ and $S(\mathbb{R}^2)$ isomorphic as extreme points of a convex set.

\section{Convex spaces}

Basic definitions for convex spaces are taken from \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/convex+space} and \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5522}. The notation and terminology will be slightly different to better map to physics ideas. 

\begin{defn}
	Given a real number $p \in [0,1]$, its complement is defined as $\bar{p} = 1-p$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{convex space} $\Ens$ is a set of elements equipped with an operation $+ : [0, 1] \times \Ens \times \Ens \to \Ens$ called \textbf{mixing}, noted with the infix notation $p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_2$, with the following properties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Identity}: $1 \ens_1 + 0 \ens_2 = \ens_1$
		\item \textbf{Idempotence}:  $p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_1 = \ens_1$ for all $p \in [0,1]$
		\item \textbf{Commutativity}: $p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_2 = \bar{p} \ens_2 + p \ens_1$ for all $p \in [0,1]$
		\item \textbf{Associativity}: $p_1 \ens_1 + \bar{p_1}\left(\overline{\left(\frac{p_3}{\bar{p_1}}\right)}\ens_2 + \frac{p_3}{\bar{p_1}}\ens_3\right) =  \bar{p_3}\left(\frac{p_1}{\bar{p_3}} \ens_1 +  \overline{\left(\frac{p_1}{\bar{p_3}}\right)}\ens_2\right) + p_3 \ens_3$ for all $p_1, p_3 \in [0,1]$
	\end{itemize}
	Given symmetry and associativity, we can write $p_1 \ens_1 + p_2 \ens_2 + p_3 \ens_3$ where $p_2 = \bar{p_1}\overline{\left(\frac{p_3}{\bar{p_1}}\right)} = \bar{p_3}\overline{\left(\frac{p_1}{\bar{p_3}}\right)} = 1 - p_1 - p_3 = \overline{\left(p_1 + p_3\right)}$. We can also extend to \textbf{convex combinations} $\sum p_i \ens_i$ where $\sum_i p_i = 1$.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	Let $\Ens$ be a convex space. Let $\ens[\rho] = \sum_i p_i \ens_i$ where $\ens[\rho], \{\ens_i\} \in \Ens$ and $p_i \in (0,1)$ such that $\sum p_i = 1$. We say that $\ens[\rho]$ is a \textbf{mixture} of $\{\ens_i\}$ and each $\ens_i$ is a \textbf{component} of $\ens[\rho]$. Let $\ens[\rho] = p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_2$ with $p \in (0,1)$. Then we say that $\ens_2$ is a $p$-\textbf{complement} of $\ens_1$ towards $\ens[\rho]$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Let $\Ens$ be a convex space and $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$. We say that they \textbf{have a common component} if we can find $\ens_3 \in \Ens$ such that $\ens_1 = p_1 \ens_3 + \bar{p_1} \ens_4$ and $\ens_2 = p_2 \ens_3 + \bar{p_2} \ens_5$ for some $\ens_3, \ens_4 \in \Ens$ and $p_1, p_2 \in (0,1)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	Let $\Ens$ be a convex space and $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$ such that $\ens_1$ is a component of $\ens_2$. Then $\ens_1$ and $\ens_2$ have a common component.
\end{coro}

\begin{proof}
	By idempotence, we can write $\ens_1 = p_1 \ens_1 + \bar{p_1} \ens_1$ for some $p_1 \in (0,1)$. Since $\ens_1$ is a component of $\ens_2$, we can write $\ens_2 = p_2 \ens_1 + \bar{p_2} \ens_3$ for some $p \in (0, 1)$ and $\ens_3 \in \Ens$. Therefore $\ens_1$ and $\ens_2$ have a common component.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
	A convex space is \textbf{complemented} if all $p$-complements are unique.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	A convex space embeds into a real vector space with convex combination as linear combination if and only if it is complemented.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Theorem 4 in \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1270} states that a convex space embeds into a real vector space with $c_\lambda(x,y) = \lambda x + \bar{\lambda}y$ if and only if
	$$ c_\lambda(x,y) = c_\lambda(x,z) \; \forall \lambda \in (0,1) \implies y = z.$$ This is exactly the conditions that the $\lambda$-complement is unique.	
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	Note that all classical and quantum cases are complemented and therefore embed into real vector spaces. It is not yet clear whether an ensemble space must be complemented or not. It is difficult to justify as it is a claim on existence of more refined ensembles. It may very well be that this is just an assumption on the decomposition, which may fail is new physical conditions.
\end{remark}


\section{Entropy}

In both classical and quantum mechanics, the Shannon/Gibbs/von Neumann entropy defines the geometric structure of the space in the sense that the geometric structure can be recovered by knowing the entropy of mixtures. It is not yet clear exactly how much of that structure is already present in the convex structure and, in general, what are the most basic axioms that an entropy should satisfy.

\begin{defn}
	Given the coefficients $\{p_i\} \in [0,1]$ such that $\sum p_i = 1$, the \textbf{entropy of the coefficients} (also known as Shannon entropy) is defined as $I(\{p_i\}) = - \sum p_i \log p_i $.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Given a convex set $\Ens$, an \textbf{entropy} function $S : \Ens \to \mathbb{R}$ with the following properties
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Continuity}
		\item \textbf{Strict concavity}: $S(p_1\ens_1 + p_2 \ens_2) \geq p_1 S(\ens_1) + p_2 S(\ens_2)$ with the equality holding if and only if $\ens_1 = \ens_2$
		\item \textbf{Upper variability bound}: $S(p_1\ens_1 + p_2 \ens_2) \leq I(p_1, p_2) + p_1 S(\ens_1) + p_2 S(\ens_2)$ 
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
	Note that the bounds for entropy can also be written as
	$$ 0 \leq S(p_1\ens_1 + p_2 \ens_2) - (p_1 S(\ens_1) + p_2 S(\ens_2)) \leq I(p_1, p_2).$$
	The term in the middle compares the entropy of the mixture to the average entropy of the components. It essentially tells us that the entropy can only increase during the mixture, and it can only increase up to the entropy of the coefficients.
	
	Note that if an ensemble can be decomposed in multiple ways, the decomposition such that the entropy of the weights is minimal provides the least upper bound.
	
	TODO: In \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02012} we showed how the Shannon entropy quantifies the variability of elements within a distribution. It would be more elegant if we would be able to rederive $I$ from requirements on convex spaces instead of distributions in particular.
	
	TODO: Does the existence of an entropy function put a limit on the convex space? For example, a line is convex space with no extreme points. We can parameterize the space with a variable $x$ such that the mixture of two ensembles is identified by the average $x$. Entropy can be written as $S(x)$. Since $S(x)$ is strictly concave over an infinite range, it will tend to minus infinity either when $x$ tends to infinity or minus infinity. Can we keep the increase in entropy bounded regardless of the distance between the two points being mixed? 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
	We can define
	$$JSD(\ens_1, \ens_2) = S\left(\frac{1}{2}\ens_1 + \frac{1}{2} \ens_2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2} S(\ens_1) + \frac{1}{2} S(\ens_2)\right).$$
	Both in the classical and quantum case, this corresponds to the Jensen-Shannon divergence \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence}. It is connected to the Fisher-Rao metric \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric#Relation_to_the_Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence} and its square root is a distance function.
	
	The question is whether the bounds above are enough to make the square root of the $JSD$ a distance function in the general case.
\end{remark}

\section{Ensemble spaces}

\begin{defn}
	An \textbf{ensemble} represents infinite copies, taken at once, of the output of a process. An \textbf{ensemble space} is a collection of ensembles that describe the same system under all processes. Formally, an ensemble space $\Ens$ is a convex set $(\Ens, +)$ together with an entropy function $S : \Ens \to \mathbb{R}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{justification}
	The convex structure captures the ability to create a mixture merely by selecting between different processes.
	
	Let $\ens_1$ and $\ens_2$ be the ensembles that represent the output of two different processes $P_1$ and $P_2$. Let a selector $S_p$ be a process that outputs two symbols, the first with probability $p$ and the second with probability $\bar{p}$. Then we can create another process $P$ that, depending on the selector, outputs either the output of $P_1$ and $P_2$. Therefore we are justifying in assuming the mixing operation among ensembles.
	
	If $p=1$, the output of $P$ will always be the output of $P_1$. This justifies the identity. If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the same process, then, again, the output of $P$ will always be the output of $P_1$. This justifies the idempotence. As long as the same probability is matched to the same output, the process $P$ is identical. This justifies the symmetry. If we are mixing three processes $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$, as long as the final probabilities are the same, it does not matter if we mix $P_1$ and $P_2$ first or $P_2$ and $P_1$. This justifies associativity.
	
	The entropy quantify the variability of the elements within the ensemble.
	
	The entropy must be continuous as small changes in the ensemble should produce small changes in the variability. It should be strictly concave as mixing different ensembles will increase the variability. Mixing the same ensemble, however, should not increase the variability. The variability increase is maximal when the two ensembles are completely distinct. In this case, the increase in variability is given only by the coefficients and must follow the Shannon entropy as it is the only continuous indicator of variability that is linear in probability. In this case, neither ensemble can be achieved by mixing the other with something else as the ensembles are completely distinct. Note that the converse is not true: the inability to create a mixture from one to the other does not necessarily mean that the ensembles are completely distinct; it may mean that finer ensembles are not available (as in the case of quantum mechanics).
	
\end{justification}

\begin{defn}
	Two ensembles $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$ are \textbf{distinct} if they saturate the upper variability bound (i.e. $S(p_1\ens_1 + p_2 \ens_2) - (p_1 S(\ens_1) + p_2 S(\ens_2)) = I(p_1, p_2)$).
\end{defn}

\begin{justification}
	As discussed in the previous justification, the increase of variability is maximal when the ensembles have no elements in common.
\end{justification}

\begin{prop}
	Let $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$ be two distinct ensembles. The $\ens_1$ is not a component of $\ens_2$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$ be two distinct ensembles and suppose $\ens_1$ is a component of $\ens_2$. Then we can find $\ens_3 \in \Ens$ and $\lambda \in (0,1)$ such that $\ens_2 = \lambda \ens_1 + \bar{\lambda} \ens_3$ is a mixture of $\ens_1$ and $\ens_2$. Now consider $S(p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_3)$ as a function of $p$. This must be a strictly concave function. Moreover, if $p \geq \lambda$ we can write $p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_3 = \left(p - \frac{\bar{p} \lambda}{\bar{\lambda}}\right) \ens_1 + \frac{\bar{p}}{\bar{\lambda}} (\lambda \ens_1 + \bar{\lambda} \ens_3) = q \ens_1 + \bar{q} \ens_2$ where $q = \left(p - \frac{\bar{p} \lambda}{\bar{\lambda}}\right)$. Therefore, for $p \geq \lambda$, $S(p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_3) = S(q \ens_1 + \bar{q} \ens_2)  = I(q,\bar{q})$. However, $I(q,\bar{q})$ has a vertical asymptote for $q=0$ and therefore $S(p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_3)$ must have a vertical asymptote for $p=\lambda$. But a strictly concave function cannot have a vertical asymptote in the middle, and therefore $\ens_1$ cannot be a component of $\ens_2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	Two classical distributions are distinct if and only if their support is disjoint. Two quantum states are distinct if and only if they are the mixture of states that belong to orthogonal subspaces.
	
	Physically, two disjoint ensembles are distinct in the sense that they will never produce overlapping results. The increase in variability is maximal and is given only by the coefficients.
\end{remark}

\begin{conj}
	Distinct elements cannot have common components.
\end{conj}

\begin{remark}
	This is true both in classical and quantum mechanics. It is not clear whether it can be proven as the previous proposition. If it can't be proven, it most likely should be added to the definition of entropy. Note that, since this specifies the behavior of entropy along a plane (i.e. among three distinct ensembles), it may be the feature that guarantees the entropy to be the square of a distance function.
\end{remark}


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{discrete finite classical} ensemble space is a simplex with the standard convex structure and the Shannon entropy.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{continuous classical} ensemble space is the convex space given by the probability distributions (i.e. probability measures) over phase space (i.e. a symplectic manifold) that allow a probability density (i.e. the probability measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Liouville measure). The entropy is given by the Shannon/Gibbs entropy calculated using the probability density (i.e. the Radon-Nikodym derivative between the probability measure and the Liouville measure).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{quantum} ensemble space is the convex space given by the density operators (i.e. positive semi-definite self-adjoint operators with trace one) of a Hilbert space equipped with the von Neumann entropy.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	An ensemble space $\Ens$ is \textbf{reducible} (or \textbf{classical}) if two ensembles $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$ are distinct if only if they do not have a common component.
\end{defn}

\begin{justification}
	Note that in all ensemble spaces, distinct ensembles do not have a common component. Therefore the definition adds the opposite implication: if they do not have a common component, they are distinct. Therefore, this excludes the case where one has ensembles that do not have a common component and are not distinct.
	
	Conceptually, an ensemble space is reducible if we can turn coarser descriptions into finer, distinct, descriptions. The above case represents two ensembles that are not distinct, but no smaller, more refined, ensemble can be prepared that represents the common part. That is, we cannot refine the ensembles in three distinct ones: one that is only part of the first, one that is only part of the second and one that is part of both. In other words, we cannot reduce the coarser description of the system into finer distinct descriptions. In this case, the coarser description is irreducible, and should not be present for a reducible ensemble space. This justifies the definition.
	
	As we prove below, that case does not exist in classical mechanics, but exists in quantum mechanics. This justifies calling the property classical.
\end{justification}

\begin{remark}
	The above property should ultimately be responsible of the single decomposition in terms of pure states.
\end{remark}

\begin{prop}
	Continuous and discrete finite classical ensemble spaces are reducible.
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
	In both cases, ensembles are probability measures: the first over the Borel algebra of a symplectic manifold; the second over the power set of finitely many elements. In both cases, the upper bound of the entropy is maximized if and only if the measures being combined have disjoint support. This means that two ensembles are distinct if and only if the respective probability measures have disjoint support. Intuitively, two probability distributions can have a common sub-distribution if and only if they overlap. Therefore two ensembles representing probability measure with disjoint support are exactly ensembles that do not have a common component. Therefore, in both cases, the ensemble space is reducible.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	An ensemble is \textbf{decomposable} if it is the mixture of two or more components. An ensemble space is \textbf{infinitesimally decomposable} if all ensembles are decomposable.
\end{defn}


\begin{prop}
	Let $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in \Ens$. Let $S_1 = S(\ens_1)$ and $S_2 = S(\ens_2)$. Let $\ens = p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_2$ for some $p \in [0,1]$ and $S = S(\ens)$. Then $2^S \leq 2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}$, with the equality if and only if $\ens_1$ and $\ens_2$ are distinct and $p = \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	If $p$ is fixed, the upper bound is saturated only if $\ens_1$ and $\ens_2$ are distinct by definition. The entropy maximum for the mixed ensemble can only be achieved when the elements are distinct, for some value of $p$.
	
	Now fix $S_1$ and $S_2$. The entropy of the mixture depends only on $p$, so we need to find the $p$ that maximizes the expression.
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			0 = \frac{dS}{dp} &= \frac{d}{dp} S(\ens) =\frac{d}{dp} \left( - p \log p - \bar{p} \log \bar{p} + p S_1 + \bar{p} S_2 \right) \\
			&= - \log p - 1 + \log \bar{p} + 1 + S_1 - S_2 \\
			\log \frac{p}{\bar{p}} &= \log 2^{S_1} - \log 2^{S_2} \\
			\log \frac{p}{1-p} &= \log \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_2}}  \\
			p 2^{S_2} &= (1-p) 2^{S_1}  \\
			p (2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}) &= 2^{S_1}  \\
			p &= \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}}  \\
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	Having found the value of $p$ that maximizes the entropy, we can calculate it.
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\bar{p} &= 1- \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} = \frac{2^{S_2}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \\
		S &= S(\ens) = - p \log p - \bar{p} \log \bar{p} + p S_1 + \bar{p} S_2  \\
		&= - \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} - \frac{2^{S_2}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log \frac{2^{S_2}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \\
		&+ \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log 2^{S_1} + \frac{2^{S_2}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log 2^{S_2} \\
		&= \frac{2^{S_1}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log \left( 2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2} \right) + \frac{2^{S_2}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log \left( 2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2} \right) \\
		&= \frac{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}}{2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}} \log \left( 2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2} \right) \\
		\log 2^S &= \log \left( 2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2} \right) \\
		2^S &=  2^{S_1} + 2^{S_2}  \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
	
\end{proof}

\section{Ensemble subspaces}

We now want to define a notion of subspace in a way that recovers the notions of subspaces we have in both classical and quantum mechanics. Given that orthogonality in all three cases corresponds to ensembles being distinct, distinct ensembles will need to belong to different subspaces. The idea is to reconstruct subspaces only from the distinct relationship.

\subsubsection{Irreflexive symmetric relations and topped $\cap$-structures}

We will first prove a more general set of results, on a generic set (not necessarily a convex space) and a relation (not necessarily distinctness of ensembles). This will give us a more general tool to investigate possible different notion of subspaces.

\begin{defn}
	Let $X$ be a set and $R \subseteq X \times X$ a symmetric relation. Given a subset $U \subseteq X$, we define the \textbf{$R$-complement} to be
	$$ U^{RC} = \{ a \in X \, | \, \forall b \in U, aRb  \}. $$
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}\label{pm_es_rComplProps}
	Let $X$ be a set and $R \subseteq X \times X$ a symmetric relation. Then:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $U \subseteq V \implies V^{RC} \subseteq U^{RC}$
		\item $U \subseteq (U^{RC})^{RC}$
		\item $U^{RC} = ((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC}$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	1. Suppose $a \in V^{RC}$. Then, by definition, $\forall b \in V, aRb$. Since $U \subset V$, it is also true that $\forall b \in U, aRb$. Therefore $a \in U^{RC}$ by definition. Since $a$ was arbitrary, $V^{RC} \subseteq U^{RC}$.
	
	2. By expanding the definition of complement, we have $(U^{RC})^{RC}=\{ a \in X \, | \, \forall b \in U^{RC}, aRb \} = \{ a \in X \, | \, \forall b \in \{ c \in X \, | \, \forall d \in U, cRd  \}, aRb \} = \{ a \in X \, | \, \forall b \in X \, s.t. (\forall d \in U, bRd), aRb \}$.
	
	Let $a \in U$ and let $b \in X$ such that $\forall d \in U, bRd$. Since $a \in U$ and $bRd$ for all $b \in U$, we have $bRa$ in particular. Since $R$ is symmetric, $aRb$. Given that $b$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $\forall b \in X \, s.t. (\forall d \in U, bRd), aRb$. Therefore $a \in (U^{RC})^{RC}$ by definition of complement. Given that $a$ was arbitrary, $U \in (U^{RC})^{RC}$.
	
	3. We again expand the definition and have $((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC} = \{ a \in X \, | \, \forall b \in (U^{RC})^{RC}, aRb \}$.
	
	Let $x \in ((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC}$. Then $\forall b \in (U^{RC})^{RC}, xRb$ by definition of the complement. Since by 1. $U \subset (U^{RC})^{RC}$, we can restrict the previous expression to only the elements of $U$, and therefore $\forall b \in U, xRb$. But this means that $x \in U^{RC}$ by definition of the complement. Since $x$ was arbitrary, $((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC} \subseteq U^{RC}$. But by 1., we also have $U^{RC} \subseteq ((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC}$ since $U^{RC}$ is just a set onto which we can apply the complement twice . By two-way containment, we have $U^{RC} = ((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{conj}\label{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties}
	Let $X$ be a set and $R \subseteq X \times X$ a symmetric and irreflexive relation. Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $U \cap U^{RC} = \emptyset$
		\item $X^{RC} = \emptyset$ and $X = \emptyset^{RC}$
		\item $\bigcap_{i \in I} (U_i^{RC})^{RC} = ((\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i)^{RC})^{RC}$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{conj}

\begin{defn}
	Let $X$ be a set and $R \subseteq X \times X$ a symmetric relation. Let $U \subseteq X$. The \textbf{$R$-subspace generated by $U$} is $\langle U \rangle_R = (U^{RC})^{RC}$. An \textbf{$R$-subspace} of $X$ is a set $U \subseteq X$ such that $\langle U \rangle_R = U$. The \textbf{lattice of $R$-subspaces} is the set $\mathfrak{L} = \{ U \subseteq X \, | \, U = (U^{RC})^{RC} \}$ ordered by inclusion.
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The lattice of $R$-subspaces $\mathfrak{L}$ is a topped $\bigcap$-structure on $X$ and therefore is also a complete lattice.
\end{coro}
\begin{proof}
	The proof assumes \ref{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties} to be true.
	
	The set $\mathfrak{L}$ is a collections of subsets of $X$. Let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I} \subseteq \mathfrak{L}$ be a non-empty family. Then $\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (U_i^{RC})^{RC} = ((\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i)^{RC})^{RC}$ by the third property of \ref{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties}. Therefore $\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i \in \mathfrak{L}$. This means $\mathfrak{L}$ is an $\bigcap$-structure. Using the second property of \ref{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties}, $X = \emptyset^{RC} = (X^{RC})^{RC}$. Therefore $\mathfrak{L}$ is a topped $\bigcap$-structure. This also means that it is a complete lattice.
\end{proof}

\begin{coro}
	Let $U \subset X$. Then $\langle U \rangle_R$ is the smallest $R$-subspace containing $U$.
\end{coro}

\begin{proof}
	Note that $\langle U \rangle_R$ is a subspace and $U \subseteq \langle U \rangle_R$. Suppose $V \in \mathfrak{L}$ and $U \subseteq V \subseteq \langle U \rangle_R$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{coro}
	The $R$-subspace operator satisfies the following properties
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $U \subseteq \langle U \rangle_R$
		\item $U \subseteq V \implies \langle U \rangle_R \subseteq \langle V \rangle_R$
		\item $\langle \langle U \rangle_R \rangle_R = \langle U \rangle_R $
	\end{enumerate}
	and is therefore a closure operation.
\end{coro}

\begin{proof}
	1. The first property is true by the second property of \ref{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties}.
	
	2. Using the first property of \ref{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties} we have $U \subseteq V$ implies $V^{RC} \subseteq U^{RC}$ which in turns implies $(U^{RC})^{RC} \subseteq (U^{RC})^{RC}$. Therefore $\langle U \rangle_R \subseteq \langle V \rangle_R$.
	
	3. Using the third property of \ref{pm_ensmblespaces_symirreflproperties} we have $\langle \langle U \rangle_R \rangle_R = (((U^{RC})^{RC})^{RC})^{RC} = (U^{RC})^{RC} = \langle U \rangle_R$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Subspaces of ensemble spaces}

We will now use the previous results where $X$ is an ensemble space and $R$ is the distinct relation between two ensembles.

\begin{prop}
	Let $\Ens$ be an ensemble space and define $\perp = \{ a,b \in \Ens \, | \, a $ district from $b \}$. Then $\perp$ is an irreflexive symmetric operation.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
	Let $\Ens$ be an ensemble space and $X \subseteq \Ens$ be a subset. The \textbf{distinct complement} $X^\perp \subseteq \Ens$ is the set of all ensembles that are distinct from all elements of $X$. An \textbf{ensemble subspace} is a subset $X \in \Ens$ such that $X = (X^\perp)^\perp$.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	Let $\Ens$ be an ensemble space and $X \subseteq \Ens$ an ensemble subspace. The \textbf{dimension} of the subspaces is defined as $\dim(X) = \sup(\{2^{S(\ens)} \, | \, \ens \in X\})$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{pure state} is a limit of an ensemble with the smallest entropy. Formally, a pure state $s \subset \mathfrak{L}$ is a non-empty collection of subspaces such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item if $\{X_i\}_{i \in I} \in s$ then $\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i \in s$
		\item if $X \in s$ and $Y \in \mathfrak{L}$ such that $X \subseteq Y$, then $Y \in s$
		\item if $X \in s$ and $Y \in \mathfrak{L}$ such that $Y \subseteq X$ and $Y \neq \emptyset$, then there exists $Z \in s$ such that $Z \in s$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{conj}
	Let $\Ens$ be a discrete finite classical ensemble space. Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the lattice of subspaces $\mathfrak{L}$ is the set of all possible simplexes generated by all possible combinations of extreme points
		\item the dimension of each subspace is the number of extreme points
		\item the pure states are the extreme points.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{conj}

\begin{conj}
	Let $\Ens$ be a continuous classical ensemble space. Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the lattice of subspaces $\mathfrak{L}$ is the set of all subspaces of probability measures with support over an open set $U$
		\item the dimension of each subspace is the Liouville measure
		\item the pure states are the points of the symplectic manifold.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{conj}

\begin{conj}
	Let $\Ens$ be a quantum ensemble space. Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the lattice of subspaces $\mathfrak{L}$ is the set of all possible density operators for each subspace of the Hilbert space
		\item the dimension of each subspace is the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space
		\item the pure states are the subspaces of dimension one (i.e. the rays of the Hilbert space).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{conj}

\begin{conj}
	Let $\Ens$ be a reducible ensemble space and $X,Y \subseteq{\Ens}$ two subspaces. Then $\dim(X \vee Y) = \dim(X) + \dim(Y)$.
\end{conj}

\section{Lessons learned}

\subsection{Subspaces from convex structure}

\begin{insight}
	Convex structure, by itself, cannot define subspaces.
\end{insight}

Initially, we tried recovering the notion of subspaces purely from the convex structure. We did make some progress in the finite dimensional case, but ultimately this does not work. The ultimate problem is that it cannot be generalized to the classical continuous case. The problem of rate of convergence is described below in the example. Even if that problem is fixed, there would be nothing to determine the dimensionality of $U$, and we could create convex maps that ``stretch'' the space.

The attempt was the following:

\begin{defn}
	Let $\Ens$ be a convex space and $X \subseteq \Ens$ be a subset. We say that $X$ is a \textbf{subspace} of $\Ens$ if it contains all the convex combinations and all the components of its elements. That is, for every $\ens_1, \ens_2, \ens_3 \in \Ens$ and $\lambda \in (0,1)$ such that $p \ens_1 + \bar{p} \ens_2 = \ens_3$ we have:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in X$ implies $\ens_3 \in X$
		\item $\ens_3 \in X$ implies $\ens_1, \ens_2 \in X$
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Let $\Ens$ be a convex space and $X \subseteq \Ens$.  The \textbf{convex span} of $X$, noted $\cospan(X)$, is the smallest subspace containing $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
	As defined, the convex span of two elements will include all their possible mixtures (i.e. the segment that connects them), all possible decompositions (i.e. all lines that pass through them) plus, recursively, all other mixtures and decompositions that can be reached from those. Physically, the idea is that not all ensembles, pure states in particular, cannot be physically realized. Therefore, the inclusion of pure states in our convex space stems from a theoretical idealization useful to decompose and study the problem. It makes sense, then, that a subspace comes with all its idealizations.
\end{remark}

\begin{example} Classical discrete subspaces.
	Let $S$ be a set of $n$ possible discrete states and let $\Ens$ the space of probability distributions over the set $S$ (i.e. $\Ens$ is an $n$-simplex and $S$ are its extreme points). A subspace $X$ of $\Ens$ is a convex hull of a subset $U$ of $S$. That is, a subspace of $\Ens$ is the space of probability distributions over a subset of the cases. Geometrically, it is one of the sides (possibly recursively) of the simplex.
	
	To see this, first note that the convex hull $X$ of any subset $U$ of extreme points $S$ is a subspace. In fact, it will contain all convex combinations of $U$, and any element can only be decomposed in convex combinations of $U$. Second, note that only convex hulls of a subset of extreme points can be a subspace. In fact, any element of $\Ens$ can be expressed as a non-trivial convex combination of a set of extreme points $U$. Therefore, if an element is present in a subspace $X$, then $U \subset X$, which means all elements of the convex hull of $U$ are in $X$.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
	The definition does not entirely work in the continuous case. Let $S$ be a symplectic manifold and let $\Ens$ be the space of probability distributions over $S$ (i.e. the space of continuous functions over $S$ that are integrable and integrate to one). We would like to have a definition for which a subspace of $\Ens$ is a set of functions whose support is a subset of an open region $U \subseteq S$. That is, a subspace contains all probability distributions defined over a subset of the cases. One problem is that continuity forces the function to go to zero on the boundary of $U$, and the speed of the convergence cannot be change with a finite convex combination. That is, the convex combination of functions that go down like an exponential will also go down like an exponential. The issue seems to be related to finding the correct closure for infinite convex combinations in the definition of convex space.
\end{remark}

\begin{example} Quantum subspaces.
	Let $\mathcal{H}$ be an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space and let $\Ens$ be the space of density matrices (i.e. positive semi-definite self-adjoint operators with trace one). A subspace $X$ of $\Ens$ is the space of density matrices of a subspace $U$ of $\mathcal{H}$. That is, a subspace of $\Ens$ is the space of mixed states over a subspace of pure states.
	
	To see this, first note that the space of density matrices $X$ of a subspace $U$ of $\mathcal{H}$ is a subspace of $\Ens$. In fact, $X$ it will contain all convex combinations of its elements. Moreover, any element $x \in X$ can only be decomposed in a convex combination of pure states of $U$. Therefore any convex decomposition of $x$ has all its elements in $X$. Second, note that only the space of density matrices $X$ of a subspace $U$ of $\mathcal{H}$ is a subspace of $\Ens$. In fact, any element $x$ of $\Ens$ can be expressed as a non-trivial convex combination of orthogonal pure states, its eigenstates. These elements will span a subspace $U$ of $\mathcal{H}$. From those elements, we can construct an equal mixture which represents the maximally mixed states and, mathematically, is the identity operator $I/m$ divided by the number of elements $m \leq n$ of $U$. The equal mixture of any orthogonal basis of $U$ will also give the maximally mixed state. Therefore, given an element $x$, any subspace that contain $x$ will also contain a basis of $U$, the maximally mixed state $I/n$, all possible basis of $U$, which means all the pure states, and finally all convex combinations of the pure states, which means all possible density matrices, all possible mixed states.
\end{example}

\begin{defn}
	A convex space $\mathcal{E}$ is \textbf{closed} if it contains all its extreme points.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a convex space and $X \subset \mathcal{E}$ be a subspace of $\mathcal{E}$. The \textbf{dimension} of $X$, noted $\dim(X)$, is the minimum number of extreme points whose convex span is $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{conj}
	Let $\mathcal{E}$ be closed convex space of finite dimensions. Then:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathcal{E}$ is a simplex if and only if every two dimensional subspace is a line segment
		\item the set of extreme points of $\mathcal{E}$ is a complex projective space if and only if every two dimensional subspace is a two dimensional sphere ($\mathcal{E}$ is the space of density matrices).
	\end{itemize}
\end{conj}

\begin{remark}
	The only if is easy to show based on the discussion above. The if part does not actually work. Take 6 points in a 4 dimensional euclidean space such that the form two triangles that intersect at a single point. All two dimensional convex spaces will be segments. However, the whole convex hull is not a simplex. 
\end{remark}
