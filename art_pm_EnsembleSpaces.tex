\chapter*{Preamble}

This is a draft of the ongoing work to define the theory of ensemble spaces, a minimal physically motivated mathematical structure that all physical theories must satisfy. The effort is run like an open source project and this is a draft created on \today. The latest can always be generated from GitHub through \href{https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fassumptionsofphysics%2Fbook&target=art_pm_EnsembleSpaces.tex&command=pdflatex}{this link}.

This functions as a preprint, though it is not published on the arXiv for two main reasons. First, the work is highly interdisciplinary so there is no appropriate category for the arXiv: previous works of ours where miscategorized in fields that were irrelevant with no possibility of appeal. Second, the work keeps going through rounds of reviews from people with substantially different backgrounds. Updating the arXiv copy every week would not make sense.
